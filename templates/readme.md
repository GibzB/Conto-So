# Azure Cognitive Service Implementation using Flask Framework
This repository is a demonstration of the process followed to implement Azure Cognitive Services in a Flask application.

## Steps followed

- Set up the Flask environment and created the app.py file as the core of the Flask application.
- Imported the required Flask functions and added routes to the app.py file using the @app.route() function.
- Utilized Jinja to programmatically inject content into HTML templates for the web pages.
- Created an Azure account and obtained the Translator API key to use the Translator service.
- Installed the required packages and libraries to use the Translator service in Python.
- Implemented the Translator service in the Flask application using Python code.
- Tested the Translator service and the Flask application to ensure that the translations were accurate and the application functioned correctly.

Explored other Azure Cognitive Services and their APIs that can be used in conjunction with Flask to build intelligent applications infused with AI.

With this implementation, you can learn how to use Azure Cognitive Services to create AI-powered applications with ease.
